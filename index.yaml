    description: 'A Helm chart for unpoller, a unifi prometheus exporter. This chart
      helps deploy Unpoller (unifi metrics exporter) in kubernetes clusters.  It crates
      a Deployment to run the unpoller container, confiuration is stored in a ConfigMap
      and mounted in the container. It supports integration with Prometheus operator,
      so a PodMonitor is created that will scrape the Deployment for the metrics.
      Optionally, it can deploy automatically the dashboards into a Grafana instance
      through the integration with GrafanaOperator: * Creates a Grafana CR with the
      credentials provided (or reuses existing Grafana object) * Creates a Dashboard
      instance for all the unpoller provided charts. See Readme.MD for details, and
      values.yaml for all the configuration options.  See further documentation in
      how to install unpoller in Kubernetes in https://unpoller.com/PATH_TBD (will
      be updated) '
